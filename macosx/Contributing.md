# How to Contribute

Wanna contribute ? Nice :D

There are some code rules, to keep the project and the code readable.

# Code Norm

### Base

##### Style
The K & R style is __REQUIRED__

```cpp
if (TRUE) {
	/* Some code */
} else {
	/* Some code again */
}
```

##### Naming convention

For function's name, go with the Javascript Naming rules:

```cpp
void	myAwesomeFunction(void) {
	/* Some code */
}
```
##### File name convention

For a class file, respect the Javascript naming rules (^)
`MyClassName.cpp`
`MyClassName.hpp`
Of course, the name of the class file must the respect the name of the class itself.


For a main, or outside-class functions, the Unix convention.
`main.cpp`
`my_awesome_functions.cpp`

> Author's note:
>
> Seems like a little complicated, but we can actually make the difference between class and functions with a ls.

### Class

##### Headers

A header file __must have__ a protection against infinite inclusion:
```cpp
#ifdef __CLASS__
# define __CLASS__
/* Header's code */
#endif
```

Also, for a class, please the respect this template:

```cpp
class	MyClass {
	// Public first
	public:
		/* Constructors and Destructors */
		MyClass();
		...

		/* Functions */
		void	makeSomeStuff(void);
		...

		/* Variables */
		int		n;
		...

	// Then, private, same order as public.
	private:
		...
};
```
The order is this one: public, protected, private.

### Comments


##### Base Header
A header file comment is required:

```cpp
/**
 * File: FileName.cpp
 * Creation: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
 * Username <username@mail.com>
 */
```

##### License
Also, we are on the Apache License, so __EACH__ file would have the following header:
```cpp
/**
 * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one
 * or more contributor license agreements.  See the NOTICE file
 * distributed with this work for additional information
 * regarding copyright ownership.  The ASF licenses this file
 * to you under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the
 * "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance
 * with the License.  You may obtain a copy of the License at

 *  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
 *  software distributed under the License is distributed on an
 *  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
 *  KIND, either express or implied.  See the License for the
 *  specific language governing permissions and limitations
 * under the License.
 */
```

#### Function comment header
A header to __EACH__ function is required too, except one-line function (Getters and setters).
```cpp
/**
 * What the function do (In a few words)
 * @param: First Parameter name (type)
 * @param: Second Parameter name (type)
 * ...
 * @return: The return variable name
 */

/* EXAMPLE */

/**
 * Count and return the length of a string.
 * @param: str (const char *)
 * @return: n
 */
size_t		strlen(const char *str) {
	/* Some code */
	return n;
}
```

# Git rules

### Commit

A Commit norm is also required:
```
Action(target): Title
<Blank line>
Description of the commit
Can be two lines
<Blank line>
```

Here action is the basic code change on a project (Add, Fix, Feat (Features), Bug, Doc).
The target is where your commit is making change (Core, Graphic design, physic motor, etc....)

**Example:**
```
git commit -m "Add(Core): Add a debug function

I've added a debug function, to close the issue #154
Also, we gain 1.3s at the build.

"
```

### Build

*For main contributors:*
Be careful, the build verification is made __after__ your push. so look at the travis icon for build.

*For pull requests*
Travis automatically makes the build, so if it failed, we can send you the debug as a comment to your pull request.

Happy contributing :)
